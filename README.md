# Money Convert - Data Structures Project

**Description**
-This is a project that will take dollar input in the form of XXXX.XX ( for example, 8950.45 ) and will output the number in english. For example, the aformentioned input would give a result of "Eight-Thousand Fifty Dollars and Forty-Five cents." 

- The program now prompts the user for a list of expenses, both the price and the expense name, and then outputs the expenses, followed by a total expense price. The previously created fuctions are then called to display the price in an english phrase.
